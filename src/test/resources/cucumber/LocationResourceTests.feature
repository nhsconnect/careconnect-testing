Feature: Location Tests (version 0.11) .N-4-2


    Scenario Outline: <reference> Location Test
        Given FHIR STU3 Server
        When I Get <query>
        Then the method response code should be <response>
        And have <resultCount> Location's returned
        And Location Identifiers = <locationIds>
        And resource is valid

        Examples:
            | reference | query                                     | response | resultCount | locationIds      |
